Migration process for subversion to git


1. Install subversion and subversion-tools packages as needed:
# aptitude update
# aptitude upgrade
# aptitude install subversion
# aptitude install subversion-tools

2. Create a file called users.txt that has this mapping in a format like this:
chacon = Scott Chacon <schacon@geemail.com>
selse = Someo Nelse <selse@geemail.com>

Extract list of authors that svn users:
$ svn log --xml | grep author | sort -u | \
  perl -pe 's/.*&gt;(.*?)&lt;.*/$1 = /'
