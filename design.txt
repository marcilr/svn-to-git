Design


Thinking that the new svn-to-git script should be implemented using ansible.
In this way all the heavy lifting can be implemented on the subversion and
git server.  Without having to transfer all the data over the wire.


The prior svn-to-git implemetation uses:


test-svn-to-git-home
  sed, svn
  svn-to-git           <=== Convert svn repo to git
  svn-to-git-authors   <=== Get authors from svn repo
